    "Code looks very neat and organized although variables are not specifically labeled. Code is documented which brings context to the purpose of the code. Code is easy to follow if I read through it line by line to figure out what is happening. The code works and passed Travis. Code looks very similar to mine so I do not have any recommendations towards improving it other than naming the variables.\n",
